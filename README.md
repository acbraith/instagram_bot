# Instagram Bot

Automatically likes posts in a given list of tags and follows users, maintaining a maximum given number of followed users. Aims to learn which users will be most effective to target to maximise 1 day follow-back rate.

Uses https://github.com/LevPasha/Instagram-API-python (included in this repository).

A /\<username\> directory should be made in the same directory as instabot.py. This should contain a YAML settings.yml file, as shown in the example directory.

Usage: python3 instabot.py \<USERNAME\>
